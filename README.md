# Football-Analysis-Project
A Complete Football Analysis With Python 

🏆 Overview

This project provides a comprehensive data analysis of football players from the top 5 European leagues (Premier League, La Liga, Serie A, Bundesliga, and Ligue 1) for the 2023/2024 season. By leveraging Python and powerful libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn, the project offers insights into player statistics, team performances, and league comparisons, along with compelling visualizations.

🔧 Features

League Analysis:

-Player distribution by leagues

-Average player age per league

-Total and expected goals (xG) comparisons

-Assist metrics (Assists vs Expected Assists)

-Discipline metrics (yellow and red cards)

Team Analysis:

-Top teams based on goals, assists, and expected metrics

-Age distribution among teams

-Progressive metrics (carries, passes, runs)

Player Analysis:

-Top scorers, assisters, and overperformers

-Expected metrics (xG, xAG)

-Positional analysis (forwards, midfielders, defenders)

🔍 Dataset

The dataset contains detailed statistics of football players, including:

-Player Information: Name, nationality, position, age, team.

-Performance Metrics: Goals (Gls), Assists (Ast), Expected Goals (xG), Expected Assists (xAG), Progressive Carries (PrgC), etc.

-Disciplinary Records: Yellow cards (CrdY) and red cards (CrdR).

Columns of Interest

Some key columns include:

-G+A: Combined goals and assists

-xG+xAG: Combined expected goals and assists

-PrgC / PrgP / PrgR: Progressive carries, passes, and runs

-CrdY / CrdR: Yellow and red card statistics

📊 Visualizations

This project features over 50 detailed visualizations, including:

League Comparisons:

-Pie charts showing player and goal distribution

-Bar charts comparing xG and goals scored per league

Team Insights:

-Top teams in scoring, assists, and progressive metrics

-Discipline comparisons (cards per team)

Player Highlights:

-Top scorers and assisters

-Overachievers based on xG and xAG metrics

-Position-specific breakdowns (e.g., defenders with most goals, midfielders with most assists)

🔗 Installation and Usage

🔎 Key Insights

Which players outperform their expected metrics (xG, xAG)?

How do leagues differ in terms of discipline (cards), goals, and assists?

What are the standout teams in terms of progressive metrics?

How do midfielders and defenders contribute beyond their traditional roles?

🌐 Example Visualizations

1. Player Positions Distribution



2. Goals vs Expected Goals (xG) for Top 20 Forwards



3. League Comparison of Goals
