# Football-Analysis-Project
A Complete Football Analysis With Python 



üèÜ Overview

This project provides a comprehensive data analysis of football players from the top 5 European leagues (Premier League, La Liga, Serie A, Bundesliga, and Ligue 1) for the 2023/2024 season. By leveraging Python and powerful libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn, the project offers insights into player statistics, team performances, and league comparisons, along with compelling visualizations.



üîß Features

League Analysis:

-Player distribution by leagues

-Average player age per league

-Total and expected goals (xG) comparisons

-Assist metrics (Assists vs Expected Assists)

-Discipline metrics (yellow and red cards)



Team Analysis:

-Top teams based on goals, assists, and expected metrics

-Age distribution among teams

-Progressive metrics (carries, passes, runs)

Player Analysis:

-Top scorers, assisters, and overperformers

-Expected metrics (xG, xAG)

-Positional analysis (forwards, midfielders, defenders)






üîç Dataset

The dataset contains detailed statistics of football players, including:

-Player Information: Name, nationality, position, age, team.

-Performance Metrics: Goals (Gls), Assists (Ast), Expected Goals (xG), Expected Assists (xAG), Progressive Carries (PrgC), etc.

-Disciplinary Records: Yellow cards (CrdY) and red cards (CrdR).

Columns of Interest

Some key columns include:

-G+A: Combined goals and assists

-xG+xAG: Combined expected goals and assists

-PrgC / PrgP / PrgR: Progressive carries, passes, and runs

-CrdY / CrdR: Yellow and red card statistics

League Comparisons:

-Pie charts showing player and goal distribution

-Bar charts comparing xG and goals scored per league

Team Insights:

-Top teams in scoring, assists, and progressive metrics

-Discipline comparisons (cards per team)

Player Highlights:

-Top scorers and assisters

-Overachievers based on xG and xAG metrics

Position Highlights :
